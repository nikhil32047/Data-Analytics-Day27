Topics + Explanations

1. Data Normalization
=====================
Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve consistency.

Example: Instead of storing customer address repeatedly in multiple tables, we keep it in one table and use keys.

Real-world: Banks normalize customer and transaction data for efficiency.


2. OLAP vs OLTP
==============
OLTP (Online Transaction Processing): Handles day-to-day transactions like ATM withdrawals, e-commerce orders.
OLAP (Online Analytical Processing): Used for analysis and reporting, like creating dashboards or trend analysis.
Analogy: OLTP = cashier at a store; OLAP = sales analyst reviewing trends.


3. Data Pipeline Concepts
=======================
A data pipeline moves raw data → transformation → final destination (like dashboards, ML models).

Example: Website logs → ETL → stored in data warehouse → visualized in Power BI.


4. Data Mart vs Data Warehouse
===========================
Data Warehouse: Centralized, large-scale storage of all organizational data.
Data Mart: Smaller, subject-specific storage (like only sales or HR).
Analogy: Warehouse = supermarket; Data Mart = bakery section.


5. Case Study: Retail Data Analytics
=================================
Retail companies use:
Normalization for efficient storage,
OLTP for transactions at POS,
OLAP for sales trend analysis,
Data Pipelines for integrating online + offline sales,
Data Marts for specific department analysis (like promotions team).
